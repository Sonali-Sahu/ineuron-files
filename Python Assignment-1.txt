## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans. Python is written in almost english words following syntax and semantics of programming language. it supports
both procedural way and Object oriented way of programming.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans. it is not mandatory to declare or specify data type of a variable. variable's data type is determined during run time. 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans. pros :- 
	a) it has very big collection of packages which makes easy to work on different domain
	b) It is easy to learn and Very productive and an interpreted language
       cons:-
	a) Python takes more time to execute as the code is interpreted in runtime.
	b) As Variable datatype is determined during runtime, it is more prone to get Runtime Error

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans. Python is highly used in Data Science , Data Analysis and Data Engineering Domain. It is
also used in Web Development, IOT and Network Programming.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans. Variable is an identifier given to value to identify and compute over in a program. 
 Syntax : (variable) a  = 10 (Value)

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans. we can use Python Keyword input to take user input from the console.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans. the default data type of value taken from Input function is STR i.e. text type.

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans. it is a method where programmer can assign datatype to a variable to do desirable operation in the program.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans. Yes, we can take multiple inputs using input function.
	ex :-  a,b = input().split()

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans. keywords are builtin reserved words which are designed to perform some specific steps
which may or may not have a return value

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans. We can't use keywords as a variable as they have a operation property defined to them.
For same reason, it may create unexpected behavior in program. To avoid this, we can create own 
non-keyword identifiers, function name or methods.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans. indentation is 2-4 spaces given to the code structure to know the
code flow and body structure under function -def ,class, if, for .. etc 
to improve the readability.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans. we can use print function to display the results/output in the console


Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans. Operators in Python are A
	a) Arithmetic :- +,-,/,//,%, etc 
	b) assignment :- = , += , -=, /= , %= , etc
	c) comparison :- ==, =<, <=, etc
	d) Logical :- and/or/not
	e) bitwise :- & , | ,<< , >>

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans. / is float division which gives decimal point with integer value.  eg :- 6/2 = 3.0
// is integer division which returns only integer value eg :- 6/2 = 3

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans. 	s1 = "iNeuron"
	print(s1*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans. 	number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
	if number%2 ==0:
    	    print("Number is Even")
	else :
    	    print("Number is Odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans. These operator are logical operators which are and/not/or.
 0 and 1 = False
 0 or 1 = True
 not 1 = False

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0

Ans. 

1 or 0 = True
0 and 0 = False
True and False ad True = False
1 or 0 or 0 = True

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans. Conditional Statements are statements which are used to make 
decisions based on the constraints/values

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans. These keywords are used to frame conditions required to get expected output. 
	Eg :
		if age <20 :
		   person is child
		elif age>=20 and age<=60 :
		    person is adult
		else:
		    person is senior citizen

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans. 
	age = int(input("Enter a number: "))
	if age>=18:
    	    print("I can vote")
	else :
   	   print("I can't Vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans. 	num = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
	sum1 = 0
	for i in num:
    	     if i%2==0:
        	          sum1+=i
	print(sum1)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans.  	x,y,z = input("Enter your input: ").split()
	if x>y and x>z :
   	    print(f" {x} is greatest ")
	elif y>x and y>z :
 	    print(f" {y} is greatest ")
	else:
	    print(f" {z} is greatest ")

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

Ans. num = [12, 75, 150, 155, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for i in num:
    if i%5==0 and i>500:
        print(f"{i} is stopped ")
        break
    elif i%5==0 and i>150:
        print(f"{i} is skipped ")
